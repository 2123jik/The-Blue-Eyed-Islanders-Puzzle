The Blue-Eyed Islanders Puzzle
06 Jan 2014
If you have never seen the Blue-Eyed Islanders Puzzle before, then hold onto your hats and stand near some sterilised plastic sheeting because your brain is about to explode. If you have seen it before but have never thought to use it at a dinner party then you are insane. In either case, be warned that you may be overwhelmed and/or seriously injured by the unmanageable influx of respect, kudos and attractive women/men/both that will follow this puzzle’s use at your next evening engagement.

The following script gives you substantial chunks of time with the whole room’s rapt attention. You may wish to use this opportunity to slip in some of your more controversial views on immigration and women’s rights. Interspersed are opportunities to sit back and watch in smug satisfaction as the minds of your dining companions are mangled more and more with every second they spend in your island world.

0. The setup
If you want to completely obliterate someone’s standing in your group (for example a rival alpha male or a romantic enemy), try and tempt them into venturing another, infinitely inferior brainteaser that you can use as a segue into stomping them mercilessly into the ground. However, by the time you’ve finished, no one will remember anything else that happened earlier, so feel free to shoehorn it in with a complete non-sequitur too. Take care not to start too late in the evening or just before an interval in the proceedings like a change of course. As with any tour de force, you do not want to have to pause for plate-clattering or mass urination.

蓝眼睛岛民之谜
2014年1月6日
如果你以前从未见过蓝眼睛岛民之谜，那么请系紧你的帽子并站在已消毒的塑料薄膜旁，因为你的大脑即将爆炸。如果你之前见过这个谜题，但从未想过在晚宴上使用它，那么你简直疯了。无论哪种情况，都要警告你，你可能会被难以管理的尊重、声望和吸引人的男性/女性/两者的涌入所压倒和/或严重伤害，在你下一次晚间活动中使用这个谜题后。

以下剧本将给你在整个房间的全神贯注中获得大量时间。你可能希望利用这个机会提出一些关于移民和女权的更具争议的观点。穿插其中的是坐下来，看着你的餐饮伙伴们的思维在你的岛屿世界中每秒钟都被更多地扭曲的自鸣得意的满足感。

0. 初始设定
如果你想彻底摧毁某人在你群体中的地位（例如一个竞争对手的头号男性或一个情敌），试着诱使他们冒险尝试另一个远远不如的智力游戏，你可以用它作为过渡，无情地将他们践踏在地。然而，等你完成时，没有人会记得之前发生的任何事情，所以随意用一个完全不连贯的话题插入也无妨。注意不要在晚上太晚或在活动中间休息如换菜时开始。就像任何精彩表演一样，你不会想要因为盘子碰撞声或集体上厕所而暂停。

1. The basic puzzle
I first saw the problem here. I will reproduce it for completeness (and SEO) in a slightly edited, dinner party optimised form. Adjust to taste:

“There’s an island with a tribe of 1000 people. 100 of them have blue eyes, 900 have brown eyes. But their religion completely forbids them from knowing their own eye colour, or even discussing the topic. There are no reflective surfaces anywhere, so each person can see everyone else’s eye colour, but has no idea what their own is. If a tribesperson discovers their own eye colour then they have to commit ritual suicide at noon the next day, in the town square, for all to see. Each person is highly devout, and there is no way that any of them would try and cheat this process. Each person is also a perfect logician - anything that they could deduce from the information and observations available to them, they instantly will.

So one day an explorer comes along, saves the lives of several children and wins the total trust of everyone on the island. In the evening he gives a speech to thank everyone in the tribe for their hospitality. However, he doesn’t know about their eye-colour superstitions, and opens his speech with “It’s incredible to see one or more people with blue eyes in this part of the world”.

The question is - what effect, if any, does his faux pas have on the island?”
```

1. 基本难题
我第一次看到这个问题是在这里。为了完整性（以及SEO），我将它稍作编辑，优化成适合晚宴聚会的形式。可以根据口味调整：

“有一个岛屿，上面居住着一千名部落成员。其中100人有蓝眼睛，900人有棕眼睛。但他们的宗教严格禁止他们知道自己的眼睛颜色，甚至禁止讨论这个话题。岛上没有任何反射面，所以每个人都能看见其他人的眼睛颜色，但却不知道自己的是什么颜色。如果部落成员发现了自己的眼睛颜色，他们就必须在第二天中午，在镇上的广场上，为所有人看到而进行仪式性的自杀。每个人都非常虔诚，没有任何人会试图作弊。每个人也都是完美的逻辑学家——他们能够立即从他们可获得的信息和观察中推断出任何东西。

有一天，一个探险家来到这里，在救了几个孩子的命后赢得了岛上每个人的完全信任。晚上，他在发表感谢部落的款待的演讲时，由于不知道他们对眼睛颜色的迷信，他的演讲开场白是：“在这个世界的这个角落看到一个或更多有蓝眼睛的人真是不可思议。”

问题是，他的失言对岛上有什么影响，如果有的话？”

Remember that your formulation of the question must:

Have a strong sense of story to draw listeners in
Be as precise as possible, in order to both head off the stupider of the stupid questions that will subsequently be asked, and more importantly to prevent anyone from claiming “oh well you didn’t explain THAT, it’s easy if you know THAT” during your grand reveal. You may wish to clarify things like “everyone has both eyes the same colour”, “everyone has eyes and no one is blind”, or just use a catch-all assurance that the question is deep, not trying to mislead and is not solved by these kinds of tricky shenanigans.
As with all puzzles of any fame, there exist a few other slightly different formulations [0][1], but Terence Tao’s is my favourite and I believe the most precise one. I have found that if anyone present at your dinner party starts trying to hijack your puzzle by dismissing it as derivative old hat, punching them in the face usually makes them stop.
```

请记住，你的问题表述必须：

具有强烈的故事感，以吸引听众的注意；
尽可能精确，以避免后续可能提出的较愚蠢的问题，并且更重要的是，防止任何人在你的大揭示时声称“哦，你没有解释那个，如果知道那个就简单了”；
你可能需要澄清一些事项，如“每个人的两只眼睛颜色相同”、“每个人都有眼睛且没有人是盲的”，或者使用一个包罗万象的保证，确保问题是深刻的，不试图误导，也不会通过这类狡猾的伎俩被解决。
正如所有有名的谜题一样，存在一些其他略有不同的表述版本，但我最喜欢的，也认为最精确的是Terence Tao的版本。我发现，如果有人在你的晚宴上开始试图通过贬低这个谜题为老掉牙的东西来劫持你的谜题，通常一拳打在他们脸上就能让他们停止。

2. The answers
I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say that anyone who is able to come up with the correct answer at this point, despite never having seen the problem before and having had a few glasses of wine, is a total genius and you should immediately start worshipping them accordingly. If anyone pipes up with “ah yes I’ve heard this before” then I generally like to suggest that we take a walk in the garden and then lock them in a shed. These obstacles out of the way, I would suggest not pausing for too long at this point, as it is unlikely that anyone will have anything constructive or interesting to say. Instead, posit these two contradictory but both seemingly convincing arguments:

2.1 Common sense
It will have no effect, as it doesn’t tell anyone anything they didn’t know already. Everyone can already see that there are multiple people with blue eyes.

2.2 Proof by induction
All 100 blue-eyed people will kill themselves on day 100 after the speech.

Pretend that I am the only person on the island with blue eyes. I would look around and see no one else with blue eyes. I would reason “oh crap, I must have blue eyes” and kill myself the next day.

Now pretend that both me and <insert name of dinner party guest> have blue eyes. We would each look at the other person and think “OK, so that guy is going to kill himself tomorrow because he is the only one with blue eyes and now he knows it”. Tomorrow comes and neither of us kills ourselves. We each reason, “oh crap, that guy didn’t kill himself because he must have seen someone else with blue eyes and expected them to kill themselves. I can’t see anyone else with blue eyes, so I must have blue eyes.” We both kill ourselves on day 2 after the speech.

NOW pretend that me, <insert name of dinner party guest> and <insert name of other dinner party guest> all have blue eyes. We would each see the other 2 people with blue eyes, and expect them to kill themselves on day 2, as above. When they don’t, we would reason, “oh crap, they didn’t kill themselves because they BOTH saw a further person with blue eyes, and expected that person and the other person to kill themselves on day 2. I can’t see anyone else with blue eyes, so I must have blue eyes.” We all kill ourselves on day 3.

Keep chaining this logic up to 100 people, and the conclusion is that all 100 blue-eyed people will kill themselves on day 100 after the speech.

(Add references to proof by induction and base cases according to mathematicality of your audience. I have found that characterising the people in the explanation as you and your companions makes things easier to visualise.)

2.3 Wtf
The question is now “which of these contradictory explanations is right and why?” Uproar and chaos will typically break out.

2. 答案
我认为这么说并不过分：任何一个能在此时给出正确答案的人，尽管他们以前从未见过这个问题，而且还喝了几杯酒，都是绝对的天才，你应该立即开始相应地崇拜他们。如果有人说“啊，是的，我以前听说过这个”，我通常会建议我们去花园散步，然后把他们锁在小屋里。把这些障碍排除之后，我建议此时不要停留太久，因为不太可能有人会说出什么建设性或有趣的话。相反，提出这两个看似矛盾但都令人信服的论点：

2.1 常识
这将没有任何效果，因为它没有告诉任何人他们原本不知道的事情。每个人都已经看到有多个人有蓝眼睛。

2.2 归纳证明
所有100个蓝眼睛的人将在演讲后的第100天自杀。

假设我是岛上唯一一个有蓝眼睛的人。我会四处看看，没有看到其他人有蓝眼睛。我会想“哦，天哪，我一定有蓝眼睛”，然后第二天自杀。

现在假设我和<插入晚宴客人的名字>都有蓝眼睛。我们每个人都会看着对方，想“好的，那个家伙明天会自杀，因为他是唯一一个有蓝眼睛的人，现在他知道了”。第二天来临，我们都没有自杀。我们各自推理，“哦，天哪，那个家伙没有自杀，因为他一定看到了别人有蓝眼睛，期望他们自杀。我看不到其他人有蓝眼睛，所以我一定有蓝眼睛。”我们两个在演讲后第2天自杀。

现在假设我、<插入晚宴客人的名字>和<插入另一个晚宴客人的名字>都有蓝眼睛。我们每个人都会看到另外两个人有蓝眼睛，并期望他们在第2天自杀，如上所述。当他们没有自杀时，我们会推理，“哦，天哪，他们没有自杀，因为他们都看到了更多的人有蓝眼睛，并期望那个人和另一个人在第2天自杀。我看不到其他人有蓝眼睛，所以我一定有蓝眼睛。”我们所有人在演讲后第3天自杀。

继续这种逻辑链直到100人，结论是所有100个蓝眼睛的人将在演讲后的第100天自杀。

（根据你的听众的数学性添加关于归纳证明和基础案例的参考。我发现将解释中的人物设定为你和你的同伴，使事情更容易想象。）

2.3 我勒个去
现在的问题是“这些矛盾的解释哪一个是正确的，为什么？”通常会爆发一片混乱和喧嚣。

3. The real answer
This is where it is most fun to let the table stew for a while. Common (and wrong) beliefs are:

There is a limit on the value of n where the induction argument breaks down
The question is flawed - everyone on the island should have killed themselves already
It has no effect obviously, argh argh rargh
The explanation is the most delicate step, and must be handled very carefully. If you do not manage to convincingly explain to your audience why you are right, you risk being seen as the arrogant, attention-seeking sociopath you are are not.

The proof by induction is correct. New information IS being introduced to the island, and so common sense answer 1 is wrong.

Pretend again that I am the only person with blue eyes. In this case, when the explorer says “it’s incredible to see one or more people with blue eyes in this part of the world”, new information is obviously being introduced. I didn’t know that there was anyone with blue eyes on the island, and now I do. This new information causes me to kill myself.

Now pretend that me and Bob have blue eyes. The explorer says “it’s incredible to see one or more people with blue eyes in this part of the world”. I already knew that there were blue-eyed islanders, as I could see Bob. But now I also know that Bob knows there are blue-eyed islanders. This is new information to me, as if I had brown eyes then Bob wouldn’t be able to see anyone with blue eyes. When neither of us kills ourself on day 1, it is this new knowledge, that came from the explorer’s statement, that cause our dual suicide on day 2.

Now pretend that me, Bob and Charlie have blue eyes. I already knew that there were blue-eyed islanders. I already knew that Bob knew there were people with blue eyes on the island, as I knew that he could see Charlie. But now I know that Bob knows that Charlie knows there are blue-eyed islanders, and this change is again what eventually causes us to deduce our own eye colours.

Beyond this number of people a detailed mapping gets very abstract and unhelpful. But anyone who has properly understood the induction should now also see the form of the new information that triggers it. As more and more people come to see the light, they will start trying to help the rest of the group. If/when they get out of their depth they will typically defer to you, making you seem and feel even more like a boss.

3. 真正的答案
这是让问题悬而未决最有趣的时候。常见的（但错误的）观点包括：

存在一个 n 的限值，超过这个值归纳论证就会崩溃
这个问题本身就有缺陷——岛上的每个人本应该已经自杀了
这显然没有任何影响，啊啊啊啊
解释是最微妙的步骤，必须非常小心地处理。如果你不能令人信服地向你的听众解释你是正确的，你就有被视为傲慢、寻求关注的反社会者的风险。

归纳证明是正确的。新信息的确被引入到岛上，所以常识答案1是错误的。

再假设我是唯一一个有蓝眼睛的人。在这种情况下，当探险者说“在这个地方看到一个或多个有蓝眼睛的人真是不可思议”，显然是在引入新信息。我不知道岛上有其他人有蓝眼睛，现在我知道了。这个新信息导致我自杀。

现在假设我和鲍勃都有蓝眼睛。探险者说“在这个地方看到一个或多个有蓝眼睛的人真是不可思议”。我已经知道岛上有蓝眼睛的居民，因为我能看到鲍勃。但现在我也知道鲍勃知道岛上有蓝眼睛的人。这对我来说是新信息，因为如果我有棕色的眼睛，那么鲍勃就看不到任何有蓝眼睛的人。当我们第一天没有自杀时，正是探险者的这句话带来的新知识，导致我们在第二天双双自杀。

现在假设我、鲍勃和查理都有蓝眼睛。我已经知道岛上有蓝眼睛的居民。我已经知道鲍勃知道岛上有蓝眼睛的人，因为我知道他能看到查理。但现在我知道鲍勃知道查理知道岛上有蓝眼睛的人，这种变化再次最终导致我们推断出自己的眼睛颜色。

超过这个人数的详细映射变得非常抽象和无益。但是，任何正确理解了归纳法的人现在也应该看到触发它的新信息的形式。随着越来越多的人开始看到真相，他们将开始尝试帮助其他人。如果/当他们感到力不从心时，他们通常会求助于你，使你看起来并感觉更像一个领导者。

4. Extensions
The amazement doesn’t stop there. You may wish to schism off a little group of those who really got the answer in order to exclude and exert further dominance over the others. You can probably let anyone you had to lock in the shed out now.

4.1 Questions
What happens if everyone knows that an islander with blue eyes was in the toilet whilst the explorer was giving his speech and so didn't hear him? What if the islander had brown eyes?
Everyone on the island knows that there will be no suicides for the first 98 days, as they can all see either 99 or 100 people with blue eyes. Is it therefore necessary to wait those first 98 days, and if so then why? (source - [0])
Having realised that he has doomed 100 people to death with his careless speech, how could the explorer minimise the damage he has caused? Would it be ethical for him to do so? (source - [2])
4.2 Answers
Blue eyes - no one has to kill themselves. Brown eyes - all the blue-eyed islanders still have to kill themselves. Explanations left as exercise for the reader.
It is indeed necessary to wait the first 98 days. As each day goes past, the lack of suicides increases each islander's knowledge of the other islander's knowledge (of the other islander's knowledge of the other islander's knowledge…etc.), and it takes this initial period for the full effect of the explorer's speech to propagate. Consider the case with 3 blue-eyed islanders - Alice, Bob and Charlie. As external observers, we know that they will all kill themselves on day 3. But on day 0, Alice doesn't know whether Bob knows whether Charlie knows he is not the only blue-eyed islander. As far as Alice is concerned, if she had brown eyes then the only blue-eyed person that Bob could see would be Charlie, so Bob could be anticipating Charlie killing himself on day 1. When Alice sees Bob seeing Charlie NOT kill himself on day 1, she now knows that Bob knows that Charlie knows he is not the only blue-eyed islander. This is not enough for her to know what colour her eyes are, but information increases in this way every day of non-suicide, until eventually the blue-eyed islanders have enough information to know their eye colour and have to kill themselves.
If on day 0 the explorer also names a specific person who has blue eyes, then that person will have to kill themselves on day 1, but then no one else will have to. Go back to the case with 2 blue-eyed islanders - Alice and Bob. As we know, without further intervention they will both kill themselves on day 2. But if the explorer tells the whole tribe that Alice has blue eyes, and she kills herself on day 1, then Bob now has no way of knowing what his eye colour is. The explorer's second, more specific statement effectively shuts down the chain of non-suicide days by providing a specific plausible explanation for his earlier, more generic statement, ending the leaking of information that these days cause. As far as ethics are concerned, it seems sensible to me but the philosophers of your group will no doubt have more to add. (Extension extension - what if he only realises his mistake on day 5? (source - [2]))

4. 扩展
惊奇并未就此止步。你可能希望从那些真正找到答案的人中分出一小群，以排除并进一步支配其他人。现在你可能可以让那些被锁在小屋里的人出来了。

4.1 问题
如果每个人都知道有一个蓝眼睛的岛民在探险家发表演说时在厕所里没有听到怎么办？如果那个岛民是棕眼睛呢？
岛上的每个人都知道在最初的98天内不会有自杀发生，因为他们都可以看到99个或100个有蓝眼睛的人。那么，是否真的需要等待这最初的98天呢？如果是，为什么？（来源 - [0]）
意识到他的一次轻率演讲将导致100人死亡后，探险家如何才能尽量减少他造成的伤害？他这样做合乎道德吗？（来源 - [2]）

4.2 答案
蓝眼睛 - 没有人需要自杀。棕眼睛 - 所有蓝眼睛的岛民仍然需要自杀。解释留给读者作为练习。
确实需要等待最初的98天。随着每一天的过去，没有自杀的情况增加了每个岛民对其他岛民知识的了解（对其他岛民的知识的了解……等等），并且需要这段初始期来传播探险家演讲的完整影响。考虑有3个蓝眼睛的岛民的情况 - 爱丽丝、鲍勃和查理。作为外部观察者，我们知道他们将在第3天自杀。但在第0天，爱丽丝不知道鲍勃是否知道查理知道他不是唯一一个有蓝眼睛的岛民。就爱丽丝而言，如果她有棕眼睛，那么鲍勃能看到的唯一有蓝眼睛的人将是查理，所以鲍勃可能预期查理在第1天自杀。当爱丽丝看到鲍勃看到查理在第1天没有自杀时，她现在知道鲍勃知道查理知道他不是唯一一个有蓝眼睛的岛民。这还不足以让她知道自己的眼睛颜色，但信息以这种方式每天增加，直到最终蓝眼睛的岛民有足够的信息知道他们的眼睛颜色并必须自杀。
如果在第0天探险家还指名了一个具体有蓝眼睛的人，那么那个人将在第1天必须自杀，但其他人则不必。回到有2个蓝眼睛的岛民的情况 - 爱丽丝和鲍勃。我们知道，如果没有进一步的干预，他们将在第2天自杀。但如果探险家告诉整个部落爱丽丝有蓝眼睛，她在第1天自杀后，鲍勃就没有办法知道他的眼睛颜色了。探险家的第二个更具体的声明有效地通过提供一个具体的合理解释来结束了这些天的非自杀信息泄露，结束了这些天导致的信息泄露。就伦理而言，这似乎是明智的，但你们小组的哲学家无疑会有更多的补充。（扩展扩展 - 如果他直到第5天才意识到他的错误怎么办？（来源 - [2]））

5. Conclusion
Once you have collected and reassembled the fragments of your now exploded brain, you will see how awesome this puzzle is, and therefore what an incredibly powerful tool it represents. With repetition, you will find yourself becoming progressively more accomplished at wielding it, and will accumulate little flourishes and accoutrements that put the icing on this already unfeasibly delicious cake. I should reiterate that you must be prepared for the inevitable conclusion where you become known for winning so hard at dinner parties that you stop being invited because you make everyone else look like massive idiots. You should also be aware that the hoards of attractive men and/or women queuing up to buy you dinner will quickly become disappointed and frequently violent when it turns out that you don’t have any other material close to this quality. I’ve heard that studying James Blunt’s Twitter feed can help, but other that this you are on your own.

5. 结论
一旦你收集并重新组装了你现在爆炸了的大脑的碎片，你将会看到这个谜题有多么令人赞叹，因此它代表了一个多么强大的工具。随着重复使用，你会发现自己在使用它的过程中逐渐变得更加熟练，并且会积累一些小装饰和附件，这些都为这个已经不可思议的美味蛋糕锦上添花。我应该重申，你必须为不可避免的结局做好准备，那就是你在晚宴上赢得如此之多，以至于你不再被邀请，因为你让其他所有人看起来像极了傻瓜。你还应该意识到，排队等着请你吃饭的一大群迷人男士和/或女士很快就会感到失望并且频繁变得暴力，当他们发现你没有其他同等质量的材料时。我听说研究詹姆斯·布朗特的推特动态可能会有帮助，但除此之外，你只能靠自己了。
